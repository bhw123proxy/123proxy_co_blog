# Bug Report Workflow

This workflow outlines the process for submitting and handling a bug report in our project.

Steps:
1. The user identifies a bug.
2. The user documents the bug's details.
3. The user submits the bug report through the issue tracker.
4. The development team reviews the bug report.
5. If accepted, the bug is scheduled for a fix in the development pipeline.
6. The team works on the bug fix.
7. The fix is reviewed and then merged into the main branch.
8. The issue is closed after confirmation that the bug is fixed.
